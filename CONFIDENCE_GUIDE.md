# CONFIDENCE LEVEL GUIDE

## What is "Confidence"?

**Confidence** is the same as "conviction" - it's a score from **0-100%** that shows how sure the program is about a trading signal.

- **Low confidence (20-40%)** = "Not sure" ⚠️
- **Medium confidence (40-70%)** = "Reasonable" 👍  
- **High confidence (70-85%)** = "Strong" ✅
- **Very high confidence (85-100%)** = "Excellent" 🚀

## Confidence Level Chart

| Confidence | English Level | Emoji | Meaning | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| 0-15% | Very Low | ⚫ | Highly uncertain | SKIP - Wait for better setup |
| 15-30% | Low | 🟠 | Not sure | MICRO - Gamble only |
| 30-50% | Medium-Low | 🟡 | Somewhat uncertain | SMALL - Conservative |
| 50-65% | Medium | 🟡 | Reasonable | NORMAL - Standard size |
| 65-80% | High | 🟢 | Strong signal | LARGE - Increase size |
| 80-100% | Very High | 🟢 | Excellent setup | MAXIMUM - Full confidence |

## How to Use Confidence Levels

### Example 1: BUY Signal at 45% Confidence 🟡

```
Signal: BUY ETH at 21,400 HKD
Confidence: 45% - Medium-Low
Meaning: Somewhat uncertain - small position
Your Options:
  🔴 Skip - wait for 80%+
  🟠 Micro - $500 (gamble)
  🟡 Small - $1,000 (conservative) ← Recommended
  🟢 Normal - $3,000
  🟢 Large - $5,000
```

**You can choose:** If you prefer safer trades, wait or go with "Small". If confident, go "Normal".

---

### Example 2: BUY Signal at 78% Confidence 🟢

```
Signal: BUY ETH at 21,400 HKD
Confidence: 78% - High
Meaning: Strong signal - go for it
Your Options:
  🔴 Skip - too confident already?
  🟠 Micro - $500
  🟡 Small - $1,000
  🟢 Normal - $3,000
  🟢 Large - $5,000 ← Recommended
```

**You can choose:** You have more confidence, so "Large" position makes sense. Or still be conservative with "Normal".

---

### Example 3: SELL Signal at 35% Confidence 🟠

```
Signal: SELL ETH at 32,000 HKD (4% profit)
Confidence: 35% - Low
Meaning: Not sure - use micro position only
Your Options:
  🔴 Hold - Wait for 80%+ confidence ← Recommended
  🟠 Partial - Sell 25% only
  🟡 Half - Sell 50%
  🟢 Full - Sell all
```

**You can choose:** Better to wait for higher confidence or just sell partial. Don't sell everything if unsure.

A: That's High Confidence. Strong signal, you should increase position size.
